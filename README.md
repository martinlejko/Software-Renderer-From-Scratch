# Software Renderer From Scratch

This repository hosts my personal project on implementing a custom software renderer from scratch using C++.

## Overview

This software renderer is built entirely without relying on external libraries such as Vulkan or OpenGL. The primary goal behind this endeavor is to delve deep into the fundamentals of computer graphics and gain a comprehensive understanding of how rendering pipelines function under the hood.

### Motivation

I embarked on this project driven by the desire to:

- **Learn Underlying Concepts:** Explore the intricate workings of computer graphics algorithms and rendering techniques without the abstractions offered by higher-level graphics APIs.
- **Deep Dive into Rendering:** Understand the step-by-step process of transforming 3D objects into 2D representations on a screen, from geometry processing to rasterization and pixel manipulation.
- **Self-Learning:** Hone my skills in C++ programming, computational geometry, and mathematics essential for building efficient rendering systems.

## Features

- **Custom Implementation:** Every aspect of the software renderer is handcrafted, enabling a full grasp of the rendering pipeline.
- **TGA File Support:** Utilizes a pre-coded class for handling TGA (Truevision Graphics Adapter) files, one of the simplest image formats supporting RGB, RGBA, grayscale, and black-and-white formats.
- **No External Dependencies:** This renderer is designed to stand independently without relying on any third-party libraries or frameworks.
- [TODO] include some demo showcase
